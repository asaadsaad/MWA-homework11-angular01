# MWA - Angular
## Coding Exercise
* Within the AppModule, create two components `one` and `two`, your task is to pass an object from the first component to the second component (through the parent `AppComponent`). 
* Implement all lifecycle hooks in all components, and write the order of when each hook is triggered during these phases:
   * Mounting the components
   * An input property change (mutation vs new reference)
   * State change
   * Unmounting the component
